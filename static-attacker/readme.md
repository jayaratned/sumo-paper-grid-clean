Potential scenario:

There is an RSU/ static attacker on the side of the road (4-lane highway) with range 'r'
Vehicles of with communication with range of 'r' will be attacked

This can be extended to multiple RSUs/ static attackers on the side of the road if above scenario is successful

Attacks can be of various types:
- False data injection
- Denial of service etc

The outcomes of these attacks can be:
- Speed changes: Vehicles can be forced to slow down or speed up (give incorrect information about speed limits)
- Lane changes: Vehicles can be forced to change lanes (give incorrect information about lane closures)
- Traffic congestion: Vehicles can be forced to stop or slow down (give incorrect information about traffic congestion)
- Accidents: Vehicles can be forced to collide with each other (give incorrect information about vehicle positions)

The attacker can also be a moving vehicle with range 'r' which can attack vehicles in its range (Next scenario)
